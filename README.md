# What this is
This project uses Angular to build a simple to-do-list. You can add the items and see the changes reflected in the table next to it. The content of the list is also stored into a JSON file by using simple JSON Server.  (This is a practice app)

# QuickStart
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to to-do-list using `cd to-do-list`
3. `npm install`
4. Run server: `json-server <path-name of server/db.json> --watch`
5. Run `ng serve` in another terminal
6. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`


# ToDoList
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
